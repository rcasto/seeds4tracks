#Music to checkout
Idea is simple:
- You like music
- You check certain places often for new music
- Let's aggegrate these sources

Personally I check the following places for my music recommendations:
- Google Play Music new music playlists
- We are the guard (best new indie)
- Soundcloud stream

Idea would be to design a model through which multiple sources can contribute to the same feed

Would want to enable the ability to remove songs that have already been checked out and were not liked and keep those or archive those songs that were liked

## Starting simple
Let's just hack together a little app that scrapes We are the guard and gets me the freshest music for the week and displays it in a simple ui (**may even just send me an email with the music for this week**)
